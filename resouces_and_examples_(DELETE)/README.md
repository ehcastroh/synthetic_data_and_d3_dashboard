# **Learn2Launch:** <br> Introduction to Data Types, Data Visualization &amp; Visual Storytelling.



**Author list:** Elias Castro Hernandez (**ehcastroh** is my handle for everything...linkedin, github, gmail, etc.)


**Learning Goal(s):** The goal of this series of notebooks is to provide users with the necessary foundations for building and understanding current state of the art visualizations. An additional aim is to provide users with an understanding of both the theory and techniques of various visualization paradigms. Finally, this series of notebooks seeks to provide sufficient knowledge to users so that they may build & evaluate various visualization systems, read & discuss visualization literature, and successfully convey visual information.

### **About**

The following notebooks were created for UC Berkeley's Learn2Launch program. They are intended to provide a rapid introduction to common python visualization libraries, as well as introduce the user to more advanced visualization libraries and engines. The notebooks are structured into 3 parts.

  - Visualization Intro 1 -- Fundamental overview of data classification theory and how it relates to visualization theory.
  - Visualization Intro 2 -- Explores various plotting libraries, and introduces more advanced visualization libraries.
  - Visualization Intro 3 -- Covers zero-coding libraries and their integration into Jupyter.
